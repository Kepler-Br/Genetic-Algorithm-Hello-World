# Genetic Algorithm Hello World

Simple python script wrote by me after reading a book about genetic algorithms and neural networks a while ago.  
Code is poorly commented, so it is not advisable to dive into it.  

**What does this code do?**  
Basically, the code generates population of chromosomes.
Chromosome consists of *gene* and *fitness value*.  
Gene is a list of numeric values.  
Program generates random chromosomes and tries to maximize fitness value.
